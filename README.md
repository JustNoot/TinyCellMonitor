# TinyCellMonitor

This is a cheaper alternative to the Batrium LongMon cell monitors based on an ATtiny13. This board can be used with Li-ion and LiFePO4 batteries to create and monitor a battery pack. A maximum of 255 cells can be connected in series and can be balanced at 1A of current.

Since the board uses standard UART communication, it can be conncted to many systems. ESP and ATmega based solutions for cenral management, logging and display are coming soon to my GitHub.
